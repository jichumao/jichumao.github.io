Welcome to Jichu's Page. 
My name is Jichu. I am currently a senior student at Beijing Jiaotong University and will be attending the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2023 to study computer graphics.
From Jan to May 2023, I worked as an intern at Apple on Python visualization software development and computer vision-related engineering development.
From Jul to Oct 2022, I was an intern at the University of Alberta in Canada on the medical image processing and mixed reality program.
